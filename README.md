### What is this repository for? ###

The goal of DOUG is to help interested developers to discuss and learn, in more depth, the technologies and tools commonly used by DevOps and others.  It is my hope that we can learn from each other to come to a better understanding of cool technologies by doing the following:

### Discussing Topics that are of interest to the group.###

   * Although we are focusing on Unix, bash, nginx & perl to begin with, we might branch out to other topics of interest that someone may have an interest or expertise in.
   * Presentations should include some hands-on examples that everyone can try.
   * Present some manageable concepts then show examples on how to do something, then have the group try out what they have learned by doing a little case scenario or quiz. 
	   * [Tell, Show, Do, review](https://maestrolearning.com/blogs/tell-show-do-review/)

### Add value to the group by adding documentation on topics learned. ###

* When we try things out it should be in a safe containerized system that will not affect our current computer setup or VM's
	* Two places that are safe are:
		* docker container (using docker desktop)
		* Your own PC (using wsl)
* It is understood that the things we learn are NOT to be done during work hours they are strictly to be done after hours.

Lets learn some cool stuff from each other ;)
